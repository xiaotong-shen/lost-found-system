# Accessibility Report

## Universal Principles of Design & Our Project

We applied the **Principle of Low Physical Effort** by ensuring that our Lost & Found platform requires minimal steps to complete essential actions such as searching for an item or posting a listing. This reduces physical and cognitive strain, making it more inclusive for users with limited mobility or those using assistive devices.

We also followed the **Principle of Simplicity**, designing a clean, intuitive interface with clear labels and navigation. This benefits users with lower digital literacy and reduces the learning curve for first-time visitors.

## Target Audience

Our main audience is **students and residents in Toronto**, especially those who need to quickly post or search for lost belongings.

## Potential Accessibility Limitations (E3I Framework)

From an **E3I** perspective:
- **Equity**: Visually impaired users may face barriers if the platform lacks proper screen reader compatibility or high-contrast modes. This limits their equitable access to the service.
- **Inclusion**: Non-English speakers may feel excluded if there is no multilingual interface, creating a cultural and linguistic barrier to participation.
- **Intersectionality**: Some users may experience overlapping disadvantages, such as newcomers to Canada who have both limited English proficiency and limited access to digital devices.

By identifying these barriers using **E3I** terminology, we recognize that accessibility involves addressing multiple layers of exclusion, not just technical compatibility.
